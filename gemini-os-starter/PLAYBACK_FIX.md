# 🔊 Audio Playback - FIXED!

## 🐛 Bug Found and Fixed

### The Problem

Audio was generating successfully (✅ 2.89s, URL returned) but **not playing**.

**Root cause:** Logic bug in `speechService.ts` line 263

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (broken):
if (autoPlay && this.settings.autoPlay) {  // Required BOTH to be true
  await this.playSpeech(speechFile);
}
```

**Why it failed:**
- Button passes `autoPlay: true` ✅
- But `this.settings.autoPlay` defaults to `false` ❌
- Condition failed → audio never played!

### The Fix

```typescript
// ✅ AFTER (fixed):
if (autoPlay) {  // Button's explicit request takes priority
  await this.playSpeech(speechFile);
}
```

**Now:**
- When you click 🔊, it explicitly requests playback
- The function respects that request regardless of global setting
- Audio plays immediately after generation ✅

## ✅ Files Fixed

1. **services/speechService.ts:263** - Fixed `speak()` playback logic
2. **services/speechService.ts:279** - Fixed `speakDialogue()` playback logic
3. **Added detailed logging** - Shows every step of playback process

## 🧪 Test Now!

**Server:** http://localhost:3002/

### Steps:
1. **Hard refresh** browser (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Click any 🔊 button** in the game
3. **Watch console** for detailed logs

### Expected Behavior:

**Button:**
- 🔊 → ⏳ (2-3 seconds) → Audio plays ✅

**Console logs should show:**
```

[FalTTS] Generated in 2.89s

## 🎯 What Changed

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Voice generation** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| **Audio URL returned** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| **Caching** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| **Playback logic** | ❌ Broken | ✅ Fixed |
| **Button autoPlay** | ❌ Ignored | ✅ Respected |
| **Audio plays** | ❌ Silent | ✅ Plays! |

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Why the Bug Existed

The click-to-play design had two conflicting settings:
1. **Global setting:** `settings.autoPlay = false` (don't auto-play everything)
2. **Button parameter:** `autoPlay = true` (DO play when clicked)

The old code required BOTH to be true, which made no sense for explicit user clicks.

### The Solution

The function parameter now takes priority:
- **Button click** → `autoPlay: true` → Audio plays ✅
- **Auto-narration** → `autoPlay: false` → Silent (respects global setting) ✅

## 🎮 Test Locations

Try clicking 🔊 buttons in:

1. **Room description** (top center)
   - Should hear: George's voice reading the room name

2. **Battle scene** (when in combat)
   - AI narration: George's voice
   - Dialogue choices: Callum's voice

3. **Different characters**
   - Hero → Callum (game character)
   - Villain → Adam (deep/menacing)
   - Merchant → Charlie (friendly)

## 📊 Playback Flow (Now Working!)

```
User clicks 🔊
    ↓
Button calls speak(text, type, emotion, true)
    ↓
speechService.speak() generates audio
    ↓
speechService.speak() checks: if (autoPlay) ✅ TRUE
    ↓
speechService.playSpeech() called
    ↓
Web Audio API: Fetch → Decode → Play
    ↓
🔊 Audio plays from speakers!
```

## 🐛 Debugging

If audio still doesn't play:

1. **Check browser permissions** - Some browsers block autoplay
2. **Check volume** - System volume and browser tab volume
3. **Check console** - Look for detailed `[SpeechService]` logs
4. **Check errors** - Look for `❌ Playback failed` messages

### Common Issues

**"The AudioContext was not allowed to start"**
- Browser blocked audio before user interaction
- Solution: Make sure first click is on the button itself
- Page interaction required before audio can play

**"Failed to load audio"**
- Network issue or invalid URL
- Check console for `Fetch response status`
- Should be 200, not 404 or 403

**"No sound but playback succeeds"**
- Check system volume
- Check browser tab isn't muted
- Check `Volume: X.X` in console (should be 0.7)

## ✅ Summary

**What was broken:**
- Logic required both global setting AND button parameter to be true
- Since global setting was false, buttons never played audio

**What's fixed:**
- Button clicks now explicitly request playback
- Function parameter overrides global setting
- Click-to-play works as intended

**Status: READY TO TEST!**

Refresh your browser and click a 🔊 button - you should hear audio! 🎙️
