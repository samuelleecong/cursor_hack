# LinkedIn Post - Cursor Hackathon Top 15

**Excited to share that our team placed in the Top 15 at Cursor's 24-hour Singapore hackathon! üéâ**

Over 24 intense hours with 500 builders, my teammates **Samuel Lee Cong**, **Aryan Ganju**, and **Shayaan Sultan** and I built something we're incredibly proud of: a 2D AI-powered Game Engine that allows for front-back handling of assets, audio, layout and combat all through AI.

Inspired by roguelikes like Hades, we created a hybrid experience that merges:
- **Real 2D gameplay** with WASD controls, canvas rendering, and procedural room generation
- **AI-driven narratives** that adapt to your choices, character class, and play style
- **Dynamic visual generation** with real-time sprite and scene creation
- **Persistent NPC memory** through our event logging system that maintains narrative continuity

**‚öôÔ∏è The Tech Stack**

We pushed the boundaries of what's possible in 24 hours:
- **Google Gemini AI** for contextual story generation and adaptive encounters
- **Fal.ai** for real-time sprite and scene image generation
- **ElevenLabs** for immersive voice narration
- **React + TypeScript** for robust component architecture
- **Vite + Tailwind CSS** for rapid development
- **Canvas API** for 2D game rendering with custom game loop

The challenge: How do you make AI-generated content feel like a cohesive game, not just random encounters?

Our solution:
1. **Visual Consistency System** - NPCs maintain identical appearances across interactions using cached visual identities
2. **Event Logger** - Tracks every player action to give AI context, enabling NPCs to remember past interactions and creating meaningful consequences
3. **Story Structure Service** - Maintains narrative coherence across procedurally generated rooms
4. **Hybrid Architecture** - Traditional roguelike mechanics (permadeath, procedural generation, character classes) meet dynamic AI storytelling

The result? Infinite replayability where no two playthroughs are ever the same, yet every interaction feels intentional and connected.

Huge thanks to the incredible organizers‚Äî**Agrim Singh**, **gabriel chua**, **Ivan Leo**, **Sherry Jiang**, and **Kaspar Hidayat**‚Äîfor creating such an amazing event and fostering builder culture in Singapore! Already discussing how we can bring this energy to NUS Hackers.

To my teammates: building with you three in the trenches for 24 hours straight was an absolute blast. Your creativity, problem-solving, and late-night debugging made this possible.

**The intersection of traditional game design and generative AI is just getting started, and we're excited to be pushing those boundaries.** üöÄ
