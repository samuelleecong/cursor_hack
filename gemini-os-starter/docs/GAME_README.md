# AI-Powered Roguelike RPG

A 2D turn-based roguelike game powered by Google's Gemini AI, where every playthrough tells a different story.

## What is This?

This is a dynamic, AI-generated roguelike adventure game where:
- **Every story is unique** - The AI generates new narratives on the fly
- **Choices matter** - Your decisions shape the story as you progress
- **Permadeath** - When you die, the game resets with a completely new story
- **No fixed paths** - The game is entirely dynamic, generated by Gemini AI

## How to Play

### 1. Setup
Make sure you have your Gemini API key set in `.env.local`:
```
API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### 2. Start the Game
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Choose Your Character
Select from 5 character classes:
- **Warrior** ‚öîÔ∏è - High HP, melee combat specialist
- **Mage** üîÆ - Powerful magic, but fragile
- **Thief** üó°Ô∏è - Nimble and stealthy
- **Cleric** ‚ú® - Holy warrior with healing abilities
- **Ranger** üèπ - Skilled hunter and tracker

### 4. Make Choices
- Read the AI-generated story scene
- Click on action buttons to make decisions
- Your choices influence what happens next
- Watch your HP - if it reaches 0, you die!

### 5. Death & Restart
- When you die, the game ends
- Click "Begin a New Adventure" to restart
- Each playthrough uses a different **story seed**, so the narrative will be different

## Game Features

### Dynamic Storytelling
The AI generates:
- Unique opening scenes based on your character class
- Combat encounters with tactical choices
- Dialogue opportunities
- Exploration scenarios
- Environmental puzzles
- Random events

### Roguelike Elements
- **Permadeath**: Death is permanent for that run
- **Procedural Generation**: Every playthrough is different
- **Story Seed System**: Ensures variety between runs
- **No Backtracking**: Forward progression only

### Character Classes
Each class has unique stats and gets different story scenarios:
- Warriors get more direct combat opportunities
- Mages encounter magical challenges
- Thieves find stealth and cunning options
- Clerics get healing and divine moments
- Rangers excel at tracking and ranged combat

## Technical Details

### How It Works
1. **Character Selection** - Player chooses a class
2. **Story Generation** - Gemini AI generates the first scene based on:
   - Character class
   - Story seed (random number for variety)
   - Character stats (HP, attack type, special ability)
3. **Player Choice** - Player clicks an action button
4. **Consequence** - AI generates the next scene based on the choice
5. **Repeat** until player dies or completes objectives

### AI Prompt System
The game uses a sophisticated prompt that tells Gemini to:
- Generate 2-4 meaningful choices per scene
- Consider character class when creating scenarios
- Use the story seed for narrative consistency within a run
- Allow for combat, exploration, dialogue, and puzzles
- Create death scenarios when appropriate

### Game State
The game tracks:
- Selected character class
- Current HP
- Alive/dead status
- Story seed
- Interaction history (for narrative continuity)

## For Hackathon Judges

This project demonstrates:
1. **Creative AI Integration** - Using Gemini for dynamic storytelling
2. **Game Design** - Roguelike mechanics with AI-driven content
3. **User Experience** - Clean UI, clear feedback, engaging gameplay
4. **Technical Implementation** - React, TypeScript, Gemini AI API
5. **Scope Management** - MVP focused on core gameplay loop

## Future Enhancements (If We Have Time)

- Inventory system (items, weapons, potions)
- Experience/leveling system
- Boss battles
- Multiple biomes (forest, dungeon, castle, etc.)
- Save/load game state
- Achievements
- Sound effects and music
- More character classes
- Difficulty settings

## Known Limitations

- Story consistency depends on AI quality
- No save system (intentional for roguelike feel)
- Simple HP tracking (no complex stats)
- No visual assets (text and emojis only)
- Story length is unlimited (could go on forever)
