# 🔧 ElevenLabs TTS Fix Applied

## Problem Diagnosed

Your 400 error was caused by:

1. **Wrong endpoint**: Code was using `fal-ai/elevenlabs/tts/eleven-v3` ❌
2. **Wrong response structure**: Looking for `audio_file.url` instead of `audio.url` ❌

## Solution Applied

### ✅ Fixed Endpoint
```typescript
// Before (broken):
'elevenlabs': 'fal-ai/elevenlabs/tts/eleven-v3'

// After (working):
'elevenlabs': 'fal-ai/elevenlabs/tts/turbo-v2.5'  // ✅ Fast, premium quality
```

### ✅ Fixed Response Parsing
```typescript
// Now checks audio.url FIRST (ElevenLabs format)
if (result.data.audio?.url) {
  audioUrl = result.data.audio.url;  // ✅ Correct for ElevenLabs
}
```

## Test Results

Tested with `node test-elevenlabs.js`:

```
Test 1: ElevenLabs Turbo v2.5
✅ Success! Duration: 2.37s
Response: result.data.audio.url

Test 2: ElevenLabs Multilingual v2
✅ Success! Duration: 2.42s
Response: result.data.audio.url

Test 3: Streaming API
✅ Success! Duration: 2.02s
```

## How to Test Now

### 1. Server is Running
```
Local:   http://localhost:3002/
```

### 2. Test in Your Browser

1. Open `http://localhost:3002/` in your browser
2. Look for any 🔊 speaker button in the game
3. Click it to test voice generation

**You should see:**
- ⏳ (Generating) - appears for ~2-3 seconds
- Audio plays automatically
- No 400 errors in console

### 3. Where to Find Test Buttons

The game has voice buttons in:

**Room Descriptions** (top center):
- Shows current room description with 🔊 button
- Click to hear narrator voice

**Battle Scene** (when in combat):
- AI narration text has 🔊 button
- Each dialogue choice has 🔊 button
- Test different character voices

### 4. Console Logs

You should see logs like:
```
[FalTTS] Generating speech with elevenlabs
[FalTTS] Generated in 2.5s
[FalTTS] Audio URL: https://v3b.fal.media/files/...
[SpeechService] Playing speech: "..."
```

## Available Voices

ElevenLabs Turbo v2.5 supports all these voices:

| Voice | Character | Description |

| **Bella** | Guide | Soft, friendly |
| **Sam** | Enemy | Dynamic, intense |
| **Josh** | Narrator | Storytelling |

## Performance

- **Generation**: ~2-3 seconds
- **Streaming**: ~2 seconds
- **Cached**: Instant replay!

## Alternative Endpoint

If you want even higher quality (slightly slower):
```typescript
// In services/falTTSClient.ts, line 42:
'elevenlabs': 'fal-ai/elevenlabs/tts/multilingual-v2'  // High quality, 29 languages
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see errors:

1. **Check API key**: Ensure `VITE_FAL_KEY` is in `.env.local`
2. **Clear cache**: Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Check console**: Look for `[FalTTS]` logs for details
4. **Test standalone**: Run `node test-elevenlabs.js` to verify API works

### Still broken?

1. Stop dev server: Find bash process and kill it
2. Clear cache: `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`
3. Restart: `npm run dev`

## Files Changed

- ✅ `services/falTTSClient.ts` - Fixed endpoint and response parsing
- ✅ Created `test-elevenlabs.js` - Standalone API test

## Next Steps

Test the voice system in your game and report:
- ✅ Does clicking 🔊 work?
- ✅ Does audio play?
- ❌ Any console errors?
