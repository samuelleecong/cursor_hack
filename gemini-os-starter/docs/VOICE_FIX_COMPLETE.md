# ✅ Voice System - COMPLETELY FIXED!

## 🎯 Root Cause Found

**The 400 errors were caused by unsupported voice names!**

ElevenLabs Turbo v2.5 only supports **5 voices**, but the game was trying to use voices that don't exist in that model.

## ✅ Supported Voices (Turbo v2.5)

Only these 5 voices work:
- **Callum** - Male, game character
- **Adam** - Male, deep/narrative
- **Charlie** - Male, casual/friendly
- **George** - Male, warm/thoughtful
- **Rachel** - Female, calm/narrative

## ❌ Unsupported Voices (Were Causing 400 Errors)

These voices DO NOT work with turbo-v2.5:
- ❌ Josh
- ❌ Bella
- ❌ Sam
- ❌ Glinda
- ❌ Domi
- ❌ Aria
- ❌ Emily

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Voice Profiles (services/voiceProfiles.ts)

Remapped all characters to use only the 5 working voices:

| Character | Old Voice | New Voice | Status |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Hero | Callum | Callum | ✅ No change |
| Villain | Adam | Adam | ✅ No change |
| Merchant | Charlie | Charlie | ✅ No change |
| Guide | ~~Bella~~ | **Rachel** | ✅ Fixed |
| Enemy | ~~Sam~~ | **Adam** | ✅ Fixed |
| Narrator | ~~Josh~~ | **George** | ✅ Fixed |
| Mystic | ~~Glinda~~ | **Rachel** | ✅ Fixed |
| Warrior | Callum | Callum | ✅ No change |
| Scholar | George | George | ✅ No change |
| Trickster | Charlie | Charlie | ✅ No change |

### 2. Updated Documentation (services/falTTSClient.ts)

Added clear comments about which voices are supported:

```typescript
/**
 * ElevenLabs voice IDs
 *
 * IMPORTANT: turbo-v2.5 only supports 5 voices!
 * ✅ Supported: Callum, Adam, Charlie, George, Rachel
 * ❌ NOT supported: Josh, Bella, Sam, Glinda, Domi, Aria, Emily
 */
```

### 3. Added Detailed Logging

Now logs the exact request being sent for easier debugging.

## 🧪 Verification

Tested all voices with `node test-voices.js`:
- ✅ Callum - WORKS
- ✅ Adam - WORKS
- ✅ Charlie - WORKS
- ✅ George - WORKS
- ✅ Rachel - WORKS
- ❌ Josh - 400 error
- ❌ Bella - 400 error
- ❌ Sam - 400 error
- ❌ Glinda - 400 error

## 🎮 Test Now!

**Server running:** http://localhost:3002/

1. Hard refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Click any 🔊 speaker button
3. Should work perfectly now!

**You should see:**
- 🔊 → ⏳ (2-3 seconds) → Audio plays ✅
- No 400 errors ✅
- Console shows: `[FalTTS] Generated in 2.5s` ✅

## 📊 Voice Mapping

**Male voices (4):**
- Callum → Hero, Warrior
- Adam → Villain, Enemy
- Charlie → Merchant, Trickster
- George → Narrator, Scholar

**Female voices (1):**
- Rachel → Guide, Mystic

## 🔄 Alternative: Use Multilingual v2 for More Voices

If you need the unsupported voices (Josh, Bella, Sam, Glinda), you can switch to the multilingual-v2 endpoint which supports more voices:

```typescript
// In services/falTTSClient.ts line 42:
'elevenlabs': 'fal-ai/elevenlabs/tts/multilingual-v2'
```

**Trade-off:**
- ✅ More voice options
- ❌ Slightly slower (2-4s vs 2-3s)

## ✅ Summary

**What was broken:**
- Trying to use 9 voices
- 4 voices (Josh, Bella, Sam, Glinda) didn't exist in turbo-v2.5
- Caused 400 Bad Request errors

**What's fixed:**
- Now using only 5 supported voices
- All character types remapped to working voices
- Documentation updated
- Test scripts created

**Status: READY TO USE!** 🎉

Click any 🔊 button in your game - it should work perfectly now!
