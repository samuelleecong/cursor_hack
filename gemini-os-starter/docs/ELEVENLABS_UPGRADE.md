## 🔧 How to Switch Back to Other Models

If you prefer a different model:

```typescript
// In voiceProfiles.ts, change DEFAULT_VOICE_PROFILES

export const DEFAULT_VOICE_PROFILES: Record<CharacterArchetype, VoiceProfile> = {
  narrator: {
    model: 'dia-tts',  // Change from 'elevenlabs'
    // ... rest of config
  },
};
```

Or per-component:

```typescript
import { createCustomVoiceProfile } from './services/voice';

const diaProfile = createCustomVoiceProfile('narrator', {
  model: 'dia-tts',  // Use Dia instead of ElevenLabs
});
```

---

## 💰 Cost Comparison

ElevenLabs pricing (from fal.ai):
- **$0.04 per 1000 characters**
- Average dialogue line (~50 chars) = $0.002
- **100 dialogue lines = $0.20**

With caching:
- First time: $0.002 per line
- Cached replays: FREE!

**Smart caching saves money!** 💰

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Let the System Choose Voices

```typescript
// Good - uses optimal ElevenLabs voice for character type
<SpeakableText characterType="villain">
  You dare challenge me?!
</SpeakableText>
```

### 2. Adjust Speed for Character Personality

```typescript
// Slow, menacing villain
stability: 0.7, speed: 0.85

// Fast, energetic merchant
stability: 0.5, speed: 1.1

// Calm, wise narrator
stability: 0.8, speed: 0.95
```

### 3. Use Streaming for Long Text

```typescript
// For paragraphs or long dialogue
const speech = await generateSpeechStreaming(longText, voiceProfile);
```

---

## 🔊 Streaming vs Non-Streaming

### Non-Streaming (Current Default)

```typescript
const speech = await generateSpeech(text, voiceProfile);
// Waits for complete audio file
// Returns URL when fully ready
```

**Pros:**
- Simple
- Works with all models
- Reliable caching

**Cons:**
- Waits for full generation

### Streaming (Advanced)

```typescript
const speech = await generateSpeechStreaming(text, voiceProfile, onProgress);
// Gets audio as it's generated
// Can show progress
```

**Pros:**
- Faster perceived performance
- Progress updates
- Better for long text

**Cons:**
- Slightly more complex
- ElevenLabs only (for now)

## 📝 Migration Guide

### If You Were Using Other Models

**Old code:**
```typescript
const profile = {
  model: 'dia-tts',
  description: '...',
};
```

**New code (auto-migrates):**
```typescript
// Just use character types - ElevenLabs is automatic!
<SpeakableText characterType="narrator">
  Your text here
</SpeakableText>
```

**Everything still works!** Old models are still available if needed.
